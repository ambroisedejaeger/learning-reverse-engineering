# Learning Assembly Series

These files are designed to help with following with the `PC Assembly Book` authored by Dr Paul Carter - [https://pacman128.github.io/pcasm/](https://pacman128.github.io/pcasm/). I've also created a series of videos that roughly follow the book, you can find that playlist on YouTube.

The following files are used to assemble programs:

- **build.bat:** Provides the commands to assemble `.asm` files and compile with `cl`. This script also produces debug symbols to aid in debugging in WinDbg.
- **template.asm:** A template to use to create your own assembly programs and use `build.bat` to assemble.
- **windbg.asm:** A sample program used to demonstrate Time-Travel Debugging (TTD) in WinDbg. The video can be found at TBD.
- **windbg01.out/run:** TTD traces from the video at TBD.
